                For my fourth co-op work term, I had the opportunity to join Camis, where I contributed to both their customer facing website and their field application. It was an incredible experience and I got great support from my wonderful teammates who were extremely helpful were the reason I could get up to speed so quickly.

                Learning Goals
            </h2>

            <h3 class="goal">1) Learn more about databases</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                Throughout the term, I placed a strong focus on understanding how our system interacts with the database. I spent time analyzing how past features were implemented and how their data was structured in the tables. This gave me a solid foundation and when I began taking database work gave me much more confidence going into it. In the end I feel that I successfully achieved this goal and was able demonstrate this understanding with my ability to write queries to retrieve information on the request of customers as write stored procedures and design tables for new features that we implemented. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="goal">2) Learn more about C# and Async development</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                During my term most of the tickets I worked on required working with C# and due to our projects async heavy design I was able to quickly improve on this goal. This frequent hands on experience really helped me to fully understand what async development is and why we use it in our projects. This not only helped for designing and planning for new features, but also while working on development stories. Additionally, I was able to begin working with C# specific features like Records and the LINQs which helped me navigate and understand our codebase.
            </p>

            <h3 class="goal">3) Learn more about software design patterns</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                My goal was to deepen my understanding of software design patterns and how they are applied to real projects. To achieve this goal I sat in during design meetings and really tried to understand why all the decisions were made. Overtime I began to get more comfortable in these meetings and even began to add meaningful contributions to the discussions. By the end of the term I feel as if I have a lot stronger understanding of the design phase in a software products lifecycle and feel that I did succeed in my goal.

            <p class="experience-body">
                As the first 4-months of my co-op term at Camis comes to an end, I'm extremely happy with my experience so far. Going into this co-op term and joining the payment team, I expected to build on the knowledge I gained during my first co-op at NCR, but the amount of knowledge I've gained so far in both software development and the payment domain has gone far beyond what I expected. I'm extremely thankful to my team for the 4 months that have past and am extremely excited to continue improving as a developer working alongside my team.
