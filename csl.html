                For my third co-op work term, I had the opportunity to join the Cyber Science Lab (CSL) 
                during the summer of 2024. Throughout the term, I primarily contributed to two major 
                projects: AI SOAR and Cybersecurity RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Overall, I had a great experience
                working on these projects with a great team.

                The Cyber Science Lab (CSL) is a not-for-profit research facility dedicated to advancing 
                the fields of cybersecurity, digital forensics, threat hunting, and AI-driven security 
                solutions. Through its innovative projects, CSL aims to push the 
                boundaries of knowledge and best practices in the cyber world.

                Learning Goals
            </h2>

            <h3 class="goal">1) Improve my research abilities</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                Initially, my role at the Cyber Science Lab was focused on research. To enhance my research 
                skills and make my findings more useful for both myself and my coworkers, I implemented a 
                consistent documentation process. This approach provided a structured format that keeps 
                my information well-organized. As a result I was able to quickly locate and retrieve documented 
                information, significantly improving the speed and efficiency with which I could access the data 
                I needed. This improved organization not only benefited my own research but also made it easier 
                for my coworkers to utilize the information I compiled.
            </p>

            <h3 class="goal">2) Learn how to use cyber security tools</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                To achieve my goal of learning how to use cybersecurity tools, I focused on gaining hands-on experience 
                with these tools to understand their capabilities and applications. During my position, I worked 
                extensively with Shuffler.io which integrates commonly used cybersecurity tools like VirusTotal and 
                Yara. I developed automated cyber workflows for various scenarios using these tools which provided me 
                with practical experience in applying them. This real-world application allowed me to see how these tools 
                can benefit cybersecurity in different contexts and ultimately helped me achieve my goal.
            </p>

            <h3 class="goal">3) Acquire knowledge of new software technologies</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                My goal was to acquire knowledge of new software development technologies by taking on new projects
                projects that utilized tools I had never worked with before. Success was measured by how well the projects 
                progressed and my personal evaluation of my abilities with these new technologies. Over the course of my 
                term I got the chance to work with technologies like Go, OpenSearch, and various tools related to LLMs, 
                such as Hugging Face and Langchain. While there were challenges along the way, by the end of my term I had 
                developed a solid understanding of these new tools and believe I achieved my goal.

                As my 4-month co-op term at the Cyber Science Lab comes to an end, 
                I’ve had a really great experience. Before this, I hadn’t worked 
                much with AI or cybersecurity, so it was a whole new area for me. 
                Working on these projects has helped me grow a lot as a developer 
                and collaborator, and I’m grateful for the chance to learn from 
                such a great team.
