                I joined NCR for my first co-op work term, which is an 8 month work term set to finish 
                in late December 2023. For the past 4 months I have been a part of a Core-Integration team
                working on adapters to communicate to bank cores. It's been a great experience on a great team.

                Learning Goals
            </h2>

            <h3 class="goal">1) Improve my collaboration</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                In the past 2 years, I have completed most of my school 
                assignments independently. As this 
                is my first time working in a software development job, I 
                knew that I would be exposed to a team environment and would 
                have to grow to become comfortable within this new role. 
                To achieve this goal, I researched unfamiliar topics prior 
                to team meetings so I would be able to contribute during 
                technical discussions. Additionally, I would constantly 
                communicate any changes that may have effects on other team 
                members when working on tasks, ensuring that they can tailor 
                their part accordingly to successfully complete our project. 
                Overall, I received positive feedback from my team members  
                proving that I achieved my goal and was a valued member of 
                the team.
            </p>

            <h3 class="goal">2) Learning and developing a strong understanding of technologies used 
                             including docker, kubernetes, GCP and more</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                The second goal I had as I began my work term was to learn and develop 
                a strong understanding of the new tools and technologies that my team 
                will use. Since this was my first co-op, I expected a big learning curve 
                with all the new technologies that I would be introduced to. To improve my understanding
                I constantly read documentation, looked at examples and asked my teammates questions. 
                After lots of effort, I developed a strong understanding of these technologies, 
                eventually getting to a point where I am now able to efficiently use them while 
                working on the development of our projects. This development is still 
                ongoing as I continue to use these technologies. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="goal">3) Become comfortable working with a large codebase</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                My final goal was to become more comfortable and confident working in a 
                large codebase. Prior to my work term, as I completed school or personal 
                projects, I almost always worked on code written by myself. Switching 
                to NCR’s large codebase was a big change, it was much harder to navigate 
                the new codebase due to the large number of ongoing projects that would 
                each have multiple other large projects as dependencies. To become more 
                comfortable at navigating this codebase, I would read through different 
                projects that my team was involved with along with other internal projects 
                that were dependencies of projects we were working on. Additionally, I would 
                often review pull requests, to familiarize myself with current projects being 
                developed by my team, and gain a better understanding of each project’s 
                functionalities. After working towards this goal I feel more comfortable 
                working with the large codebase and can now navigate to find different 
                classes and files without needing assistance.

                As my first 4 month co-op term has come to an end, I have had a great experience 
                working at NCR. My skills as a developer and collaborator have improved 
                significantly as I have moved from project to project with my Core-Integration 
                team. I am excited for the next 4 months to continue to build upon the 
                skills I have learned and help my team achieve our goals.
