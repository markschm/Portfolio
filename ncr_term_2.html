                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p class="experience-body">
                This work term report is about the second 4 month term of my 8 month co-op term at 
                NCR Voyix (formerly known as NCR). For the past 8 months I have been part of the Nexus, 
                Core-Integration team. During my time on the team we have created an adapter, built a 
                standardized library to be used for other spring-based adapters and provided fixes and 
                updates to adapters in use. These adapters play an important role at NCR Voyix, as they 
                are used by other teams to communicate with core banking systems provided to the 
                company by financial institutions.

                Information About The Employer
            </h2>
            <p class="experience-body">
                NCR Voyix, originally founded in 1884 selling cash registers, is the world's leading 
                enterprise provider of software, hardware and services for banks, retailers, 
                restaurants, small business and telecom & technology. When I first began my co-op in 
                May 2023, the company was known as NCR. However, in October, NCR officially split into 
                2 companies, NCR Atleos and NCR Voyix (which my team is a part of).

                Learning Goals
            </h2>

            <h3 class="goal">1) Improve Debugging Skills</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                After the initial 4 months of my co-op term, I had gained a solid understanding of our 
                team's work and began receiving more tickets. I found debugging was a task that 
                frequently was taking up a significant portion of my time at work and to increase the 
                speed at which I'm able to complete the tickets I was assigned, I thought this would 
                be a great skill to work on. To work towards this goal, I started picking up more bug 
                related tickets to gain more practice as that's the best way to improve. I discovered 
                a few techniques during this practice that I found were greatly increasing the speed at 
                which I was able to find and fix the issue within the code. Additionally, I also asked 
                around to my teammates during this process and got some tips and tricks from them, which 
                I was quickly able to apply and practice on the bug tickets I worked on. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="goal">2) Improve Spring-boot and Java knowledge</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                Since this was my second 4 month term at NCR Voyix on the same team, I took this term to 
                try and really get a deep understanding of backend development, with a specific focus on 
                Java and Spring-boot. To improve my knowledge of both Spring-boot and Java, I began with 
                my usual method of learning and practiced as well as used the crazy amount of projects I 
                had access to at NCR Voyix to read more code. While I would read through the projects, I 
                would look to see how it was structured, how different classes were designed and tried to 
                find things that confused me, as I knew if this was the case there was something to learn 
                and I would start doing my research. During this time, a teammate recommended an online 
                course on Java performance and memory management which I began taking. This course taught 
                me a lot about when to use different data structures, the inner workings of Java and the 
                JVM. This new information I gained from this course allowed me to find places in our own 
                work that improvements could be made as well as sparked discussions where I could learn 
                even more from my teammates.
            </p>

            <h3 class="goal">3) Improve my ability to participate in technical discussions</h3>
            <p class="experience-body">
                Since our team was working on the development of a new adapter, we were frequently 
                discussing with our senior developers and architects outside our team to ensure we're 
                following best practices. Given that the new adapter was written in Java and Spring-boot 
                these discussions both helped me work towards my previous goal as well as my previous goal 
                helped me work towards this goal as it gave me a better understanding of the topics of 
                discussion. Additionally, I would prepare before the calls by doing my own research on the 
                topics and if we're deciding between a few options looking into each and trying to think 
                about how each will be able to suit our needs and if there's any functionality that would 
                be missing. This preparation and the knowledge I gained about Java and Spring-boot throughout 
                the term allowed me to achieve my goal and contribute meaningful information to the 
                discussions and helped to ensure that our team was building the adapter in the best way possible.

                As the final 4 months of my co-op at NCR Voyix has come to an end, I can look back and see how 
                much I've grown as a developer. Working as a co-op at NCR Voyix has been an amazing opportunity 
                and it far exceeded the expectations I had set before the placement. During my time I got to 
                work with my amazing team members that were always there anytime I had a question or wanted to 
                play ping pong! I also got to meet many other incredible co-workers including other co-ops and 
                full timers making many new friends while there. The past 8 months were an amazing experience, 
                and I'm very excited for my next co-op!
